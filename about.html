            <h1>Welcome To My Page!</h1>
            
            <p>Given that I am half Colombian and half Venezuelan. I take pride in bringing my multi-cultural upbringing to my designs. As you will see throughout my portfolio that are not only colorful and bold but highly organized and detailed-oriented. 
                ‍
                I do not only strive to design great experiences, but devote my energy in staying on top of the latest trends and challeging myself to better in each project I produce. Working with talented creatives from different specifications provide an endless source of inspiration for me. It truly drives my curiosity and is one of the main reasons I got into design. 
                
                With that being said, family comes first for me. I am happily married with two children that are my world. I love exposing them to my different creative passions and seeing them develop their own. My hope is that they develop a sense of curiosity like I have and produce something that will change that someone views the world, as some many have done for me. </p>

            <p>Photography is my first love. There is nothing like catching the perfect sunset, intriguing architecture, or candids of people living their lives. My dream is to put together a coffee table book of some my favorite photos. </p>

            <p>My family and friends are my WORLD! I have no idea what I do without them in my life!! My husband and kids give me so much joy and it definetly comes through in my work. Providing that sense of ‘love’ to my work, I feel absolutely sets me apart. </p>

            <p>Lastly, I was fortunate to grow up on a farm run by my grandparents. Everyday was a new experience working with the different animals and its where I developed my passions for the outdoors. Also I LOVE horses, such gentle giants, I miss them so much!!</p>
